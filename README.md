# 💡 Interactive 3D Lamp Login

A creative, physics-based login interface built with Vanilla JS and CSS3. The project features a draggable pull-cord that controls the ambient lighting and UI theme of the page.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Physics-Based Interaction:** Custom JavaScript physics engine (`Math.atan2`) simulates realistic cord swinging and dragging.
- **Dynamic Lighting Engine:** Pulling the cord cycles through **25 distinct color themes**, updating the lamp glow, light beam, and form accents instantly.
- **Privacy-Aware UI:**
  - *Username Focus:* The lamp's eyes follow your input (Look Direction).
  - *Password Focus:* The lamp closes its eyes (Privacy Mode).
- **Glassmorphism Design:** Frosted glass effect on the login form with dynamic borders that reflect the current light color.
- **Fully Responsive:** Adapts from a side-by-side desktop view to a vertical mobile layout with touch support.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
- **CSS3:** Radial Gradients, CSS Variables, Keyframes, and Media Queries.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Event listeners, DOM manipulation, and vector math.
